After the realization that I would not be joining the military, I knew God had another plan in store for me. I had spent years building computers for family/friends, taking computer hardware/software classes in high school, and being the go-to tech guru. I knew the next step was to continue my education in Information Technology. I am a motivated self-starter with experience in Customer Relations and Computer Systems, and I have the proven ability to work well in difficult situations while providing a high level of customer service to clients. I enjoy learning and working with computers, and my overall GPA of 3.9 at Nashville State reflects my enthusiasm and work ethic. I am hardworking, dependable, and honest.
